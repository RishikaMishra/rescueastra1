5. **`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`** - Added permissions

## 🔧 Dependencies Added

```yaml
geolocator: ^10.1.0           # GPS location services
permission_handler: ^11.3.1   # Runtime permissions
telephony: ^0.2.0            # SMS functionality
camera: ^0.10.5+9            # Camera for video recording
path_provider: ^2.1.2        # File system access

## 🛡️ Permissions Configured

### Android Permissions (Added to AndroidManifest.xml):

- ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
- SEND_SMS
- CALL_PHONE
- RECORD_AUDIO
- CAMERA

- READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- INTERNET
- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
- VIBRATE

## 🎯 How It Works

### SOS Activation Process:
1. **User presses SOS button**
2. **Permission check** - Requests missing permissions
3. **Location fetch** - Gets current GPS coordinates
4. **SMS alerts** - Sends to all emergency contacts
5. **Emergency call** - Dials emergency number
6. **Recording starts** - Audio/video recording begins
7. **Visual feedback** - Button pulses red, shows "SOS ACTIVE"
8. **Auto-stop** - Recording stops after 30 seconds
9. **Cloud upload** - Files uploaded to Firebase
10. **Emergency log** - Data saved to Firestore

### Emergency Stop Process:
1. **User taps active SOS button**
2. **Confirmation dialog** - "Cancel SOS?" with options
3. **Stop recordings** - Immediately stops all recording
4. **Upload or delete** - User choice to upload or delete files
5. **Reset state** - Returns to normal operation

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic SOS Button:
```dart
SOSButton(
  size: 70,
  showLabel: true,
  onSOSActivated: () {
    // Optional callback
  },
)
```

### Global SOS for Any Screen:
```dart
SOSEnabledScreen(
  showSettingsButton: true,
  child: YourScreenWidget(),
)
```

### Emergency Settings:
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => EmergencySettingsPage(),
  ),
);
```

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Normal**: Red circle with SOS icon
- **Active**: Pulsing red circle with stop icon
- **Loading**: Shows activation progress
- **Error**: Displays error messages

### Visual Feedback:
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded status indicators
- Progress dialogs during activation
- Success/error notifications

### Settings Interface:
- Emergency contacts management
- Emergency number configuration
- Permission status checking
- Feature explanation and help

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Protection:
- All recordings encrypted in transit
- Firebase Storage with authentication
- Local files in app-private directories
- No third-party data sharing

### Permission Handling:
- Runtime permission requests
- Graceful degradation when permissions denied
